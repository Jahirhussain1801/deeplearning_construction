🦺 Construction Worker Safety Detection using YOLOv8

This project leverages YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) — a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection — to ensure safety compliance on construction sites. The system automatically detects whether workers are wearing essential safety equipment such as helmets, vests, and safety glasses, helping to improve workplace safety and reduce accidents.

The model was trained on a custom dataset curated from real-world construction images. Data was annotated using Roboflow, and the YOLOv8 model was fine-tuned through transfer learning with data augmentation techniques (flipping, rotation, lighting variations) to improve accuracy and robustness.

For deployment, the system integrates Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly web interface. It supports real-time detection using OpenCV, making it suitable for integration with CCTV feeds or on-site monitoring systems.
